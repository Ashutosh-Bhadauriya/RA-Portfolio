      <h1>Is Programming for Everyone..?ðŸ¤”</h1>
      <p>
        So, What do you think? According to me it depends on an individual. If a
        person decides to enter in programming with a Never Give Up attitude
        then sure he can do it but if someone has already made his mind that it
        is not for me, then nothing can change it. It is a person's attitude
        that decides if he is going to be successful in the field chosen by him
        or not.
      </p>
      <h2>Story Time..</h2>
      <h2>Why is the Lion considered King of Jungle?</h2>
      <p>
        Is it the biggest? No, Elephants are bigger. Is it the smartest? No,
        Hyenas are smarter than Lions. So, it might be the most intelligent. The
        answer is no again. Chimpanzees are more intelligent. It is not the
        tallest as well, Giraffe is taller.
      </p>
      <p>
        But but but...When an elephant sees a lion, he runs, even though he's
        bigger, stronger, smarter and more powerful than a Lion. So, why is it?
        The elephant is a victim of how he thinks!! When the lion sees an
        elephant, he runs towards the elephant because he believes that he can
        hop on elephant and eat it.
      </p>
      <h2>What's wrong here?</h2>
      <p>
        Any guesses? Yes, you guessed it right. The lion is the king of the
        Jungle because he thinks he is. He has different attitude and his
        actions reflect the way he thinks. This attitude makes all the animal
        kingdom respect the lion more than any other animal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attitude is the result of our beliefs. Our actions reflect what we
        believe. We become what we believe. We limit ourselves by what we
        believe. So, the need of the hour is to start believing in yourself and
        stop putting yourself down and have confidence in your belief.
      </p>
      <h2>No one can live beyond the limits of their beliefs.</h2>
      <p>
        So, stop thinking "I can't do this." Stop making excuses. Is someone
        say's you can't do it, let them say and you do what you believe. Change
        your belief system. Your ability to become a programmer is trapped by
        you and your belief.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope this was the motivation you needed to start your programming
        journey. Thanks for reading and let's start our journey together. Have an amazing day..âœŒ
