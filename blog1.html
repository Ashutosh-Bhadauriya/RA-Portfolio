      <h1>The basics of Programming</h1>
      <p>
        Hello 👋 Coders, This is my first blog post so thought why not cover the
        basics as it will be easy for me to start with and easy for you to
        understand if you're beginning your coding journey.
      </p>
      <h2>So, let's start with one step at a time..</h2>
      <h2>What is Programming?</h2>
      <p>
        Programming is the process of giving computer intructions on how to act.
        Yes, this is it. Wait wait..how can one give instructions of computer.
        Do Computers understand us? The answer is no, Computers cannot
        understand us. They understand only binaries (0 and 1). The instructions
        that we give them are given through code.
      </p>
      <p>This code can be in various programming languages.</p>
      <p>
        Programming language is a language that is used by programmers to
        communicate with computers. It is a set of instructions written in any
        specific language like C++, Java, Pyhton, etc.
      </p>
      <p>There are five basic concepts in any Programming Language..</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Variables</li>
        <li>Conditional Statetments</li>
        <li>Looping & Iteration</li>
        <li>Data types and Data Structures</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <p>
        Consider them a boxes, that are used to store data or reference to data.
        There can be many properties of variables like a name, type, value,
        scope, lifetime and location. We'll discuss them in details in my future
        posts as this is out of scope for now.
      </p>
      <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
      <p>
        These statements are also known as "if-else" statements, and it is as
        simple as it sounds. Yeah, you guessed it right. If the given condition
        satisfies do this or do that (execute else codition).
      </p>
      <h2>Iteration & Looping</h2>
      <p>
        Let me ask you something. What if you want to print some statement more
        than 100 times. What will you do? OK OK I am not considering that your
        typing speed is 200 wpm. Even if you have, why will you type something
        again and again if you can do the same in less than 3 lines. Here comes
        iteration and looping. If program repeats a sequence or process, that is
        an iteration. Loops are a type of iteration, where a program carries out
        an action until new condition is met. In easier words, you will not need
        to write the same thing again and again.
      </p>
      <h2>Data Types & Data Structures</h2>
      <p>
        A Data Type is the most basic classification of a data. So, basically it
        is the type of any variable used in the code. Some of the basic examples
        are int, double , string, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data Structures on the other hand are a collection of data types. It is
        a way of organizing the items in terms of memory, and also the way of
        accessing each item through some defined logic. Some examples of data
        structures are stacks, queues, linked lists, binary tree and many more.
        I know this might be too much. Don't worry about them now, you do not
        need to deal with them initially.
      </p>
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <p>
        A function is a contained block of code that can perform an action. For
        now you can remeber them as they are the "something" which can be used
        multiple times in a program and allows use to reuse the same piece of
        code instead of writing it again and again.
      </p>
      <p>I'm sure this was helpful. Good Luck to your programming journey.</p>
